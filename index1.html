<code> “Your work is going to fill a large part of your life, and the only way to be truly satisfied is to do what you believe is great work. And the only way to do great work is to love what you do. If you haven't found it yet, keep looking. Don't settle. As with all matters of the heart, you'll know when you find it.” — Steve Jobs </code>

  <p> If you're trying to get into a new field you have to learn what skills the job requires. An once you've done a little learning, do a whole lot more.There are so many ways to learn about a topic. First and foremost, Google is Free and combined with Youtube University you can truly come close to an expert. </p>
  <p> If being self-taught is some you can manage, there are some many resources out there like Udemy and Udacity. If you need a more guided lesson with a teacher and peers to bounce ideas and questions off of, try to find bootcamps and panels- there are even some free ones if you look hard enough. </p>

  <headerid="header" >Practice Makes Progress</header> 
  <p>I'm sure we all have heard the phrase, "Practice Makes Perfect" but I think we should stop aiming for perfect and focus on progress. </p>
  <p>Practice is the repeated performance to acquire skill or proficieny. With enough practice, a beginner coding student can become a skilled programmer, a poor communicator can lead large meetings, and so on. Practice makes progress and before you know it you'll have achieved some of your goals and need to create bigger ones.   </p>

  <p>It's important to build your network! Having a network allows you to have people who can vouch for you and provide referrals, which is a huge advantage in the interview process. Utilizing your network allows you to discover opportunities and learn about what other career fields are out there. </p>
  <p>Find a mentor and don't be afraid to reach out to people! It's all about your approach and 9 times out of 10, someone will respond back and give you some insight. Informational interviews is incredibly helpful to get to know someone, build a relationship and expand your network!  </p>
